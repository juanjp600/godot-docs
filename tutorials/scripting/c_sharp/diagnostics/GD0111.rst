Cause
-----

A type that has the ``Tool`` attribute contains an exported field or property of
a script type that doesn't have the ``Tool`` attribute.

Rule description
----------------

Script types that do not have the ``Tool`` attribute are not instantiated by
the editor. Types that do have the ``Tool`` attribute cannot interact with these
script types within the editor.

How to fix violations
---------------------

To fix a violation of this rule, avoid exporting non-tool members from a tool type,
add the ``Tool`` attribute to the type of the exported member, or remove the ``Tool``
attribute from the type that has the exported member.

When to suppress warnings
-------------------------

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Types that don't have the ``Tool``
attribute will not be instantiated by the editor, resulting in unexpected runtime
errors when attempting to set a value to the exported member.
